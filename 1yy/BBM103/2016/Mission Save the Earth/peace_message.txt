Binarians, our fellow inhabitants of this universe, we greet you in peace.
It is very unfortunate that our first encounter 
happened under such terrible circumstances. Although you have every right to think that we are 
nothing but a barbaric race which does not deserve this beautiful planet Earth, we assure 
you that we are much more than that. We wish 
to prove you this 
by first letting you know that we decrypted your transmission and learned some interesting things 
about your planet. You call it Xenu, but here on Earth we call it HD 85512 b.

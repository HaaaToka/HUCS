Binarians, our fellow inhabitants of this universe, I greet you
in peace.
I have around 230 awsome students who sometimes drive me
crazy.
I give them all of the necessary material to study
before their lab sessions and quizzes, but
some of them still come unprepared. I really want
them not just to learn, but
also to
fall in love with programming, as I did 22 years ago. I do not
know what else to
do to make them more motivated. Some of them are very hard-working
and this makes me very happy. I just wish everyone
would have the same motivation.
Nevertheless, I like my students a lot. I love their sense of humor,
they make me
laugh, and I think they will be great engineers one day, once they
understand the importance of hard work. So, I
beg you not to kill us all. Give us more time, say 100 years, and
when you come back
you will see that we have changed and become better people.
